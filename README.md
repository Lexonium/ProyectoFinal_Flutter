# ProyectoFinal_Flutter
Proyecto final de la materia dise√±o de aplicaciones moviles.

The goal of this proyect was to make an application that utilizes an API and would serve to showcase the tools I have learned throughout the class.
I decided to do an Ubereats like application where you could place orders for many different types of cookie, where afterwards you could see the route
the driver would have to take through a google maps api. The api is now shut off for security purposes.
